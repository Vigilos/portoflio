    "description": "I have loved technology since I was a kid. I couldn’t get enough of building electronic circuits or programming, starting all the way back in third grade. I turned that passion into a career, and worked 17 years in the IT industry, as a computer technician, software developer and network engineer. And, moved my way up the leadership chain, working as a VP of technical support and the COO of a cybersecurity company. I then switched gears, in order to better serve my country, and become a Special Agent in the FBI for 12 years, where I had the opportunity to continue my passion as both a tech agent and in conducting cyber operations. Alongside my civilian career, I have spent over 25 years in the military reserve and currently serve as a lieutenant colonel in the Air National Guard. One constant across everything I’ve done is that I love problem-solving, and leading and mentoring people. I have experience with multiple computer languages, to include JavaScript, Python and PHP. I'm currently looking for a position in software development as either a software engineer or development team leader.",
