    "description": "I have been in love with computer technology since I was 10 years old. I am a long-time IT professional, with 17 years in the tech industry as a software developer and network engineer. I also spent 12 years in the FBI as a Special Agent, where I had the opportunity to gain more experience with cybersecurity and managing large, multi-agency projects. What excites me most in any job is solving problems and bringing success to my organization and team. I have always loved programming, since I was in 3rd grade, and have experience with multiple computer languages, to include JavaScript, Python and PHP. I'm currently looking for a position in software development as either a software engineer or development team leader.",
